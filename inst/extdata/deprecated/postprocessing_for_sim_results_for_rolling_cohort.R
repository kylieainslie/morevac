#' Multi-annual model of infection and vaccination (version 2)
#'
#' This function post processes simulation results for a rolling cohort.
#' @param sim_dat list of sparse matrices of simulations results (no vac)
#' @param n_sim number of simulations performed (must be the same for each sim case)
#' @param total_year_range vector of years simulations were run over (YYYY format)
#' @param length_study number of years to get cohorts from
#' @param write_file logical. If TRUE, writes infection and vaccination histories for cohorts to csv file
#' @param file character string indicating the name of the output file. Only used when write.file = TRUE.
#' @return data frame of attack rates within the cohort by year
#' @keywords morevac
