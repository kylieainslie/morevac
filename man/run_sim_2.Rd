\arguments{
\item{sim}{number of simulations to run}

\item{n}{number of individuals to be simulated}

\item{years}{vector of years in YYYY format}

\item{max_age}{maimum age of an individual before they are removed from the population}

\item{start_vac_year}{year to start vaccinating (YYYY format)}

\item{vac_cov}{vector of vaccination coverages for each age group (should be of length max_age)}

\item{betas}{vector of force of infetion for each year (should be same length as years)}

\item{vac_protect}{vaccine efficacy}

\item{vac_strategy}{integer indicating which vaccination strategy to use (0 = no vaccination, 1 = annual, 2 = biennial)}

\item{rho}{correlation of repeat vaccination in individuals (between 0 and 1 (inclusive))}

\item{wane}{amount of vaccine waning}

\item{take}{proportion of individuals who receive the vaccine and are protected}

\item{epsilon}{exposure penalty}

\item{drift_off}{logical. if TRUE there will be no antigenic drift}

\item{trim_age_mat}{year before which age matrix is subsetted. If the year 2000 is used, then age matrix will only contain ages for year 2000 and beyond.}

\item{length_study}{length of time to follow cohorts}

\item{seed}{seed for simulations}
